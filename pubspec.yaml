publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

    #     - asset: fonts/RobotoMono-Regular.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/RobotoMono-Bold.ttf

    # - family: Raleway
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
    #       style: italic
  #   - family: Schyler
